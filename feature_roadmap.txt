This is the feature roadmap for Bryan's Type Teach program


Goal for 9/3/23
- As a developer, I can push code to Github
- As a user, I can start the program using a config file
- As a user, I can be prompted 10 different "sentences" to type against
- As a user, I can be shown my Accuracy and Speed (WPM) at the end of session


Future features:
- As a user, I see historical stats of my performance over time
